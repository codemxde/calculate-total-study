# Calculate Total Study
Simple terminal application to calculate your total time spent while studying

## Input Format
Your input should be an _integer_ or _decimal_ value, like '1' or '1.25' <br>
'1.25' represents **1 hour 25 minutes** and <i>not</i> 1.25 hours <br>
## NOTE
Avoid giving more than 4 input characters, for '1.255' only first three digits i.e. '1.25' would be considered<br>
Hence, '1.25545...' would get considered as _'1.25'_ or **1 hour 25 minutes**

## Upcoming
A more robust validation for backend such that user input restrictions could be better handled
